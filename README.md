# Automated Schematic Generator 

Nothing special, just automatically gets a schematic of an area within a grid cell across a huge grid of buildings. 

For reference, this is what I'm working with

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="./images/mushroom-pack.png" alt="The Mushroom Pack" width="400">
</div>
